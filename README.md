<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>This project utilizes the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm, which is based on AES-128-CBC.</p>

<p>The project also employs the PBKDF2HMAC password hashing algorithm, which is designed to be slow and computationally expensive.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and run the (link unavailable) file using Python.</p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

<p>Contributions to this project are welcome! Please submit a pull request with your changes, and ensure that all code is properly tested and documented.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>This project would not have been possible without the support of the open-source community and the contributions of various encryption libraries.</p>
