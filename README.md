# Python-Encryption-Script
This Python script implements a simple Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text. The script allows users to input a text and a shift value, then outputs the encrypted text and its decrypted form. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter by a specified number of places in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.
